        <h2>A simple matcha latte recipe that is great for your health.</h2>
        <p>Matcha, a powder made from ground green tea leaves, has two main grades. Ceremonial is the highest quality; it's produced from the season's first harvest. Because the leaves are young, they have more chlorophyll and hence the most vibrant color. The stems and veins are removed prior to the grinding process, making for a sweeter flavor and finer texture. Ceremonial matcha is intended to be enjoyed on its own.</p>
        <p>The second matcha category is culinary grade, which is harvested later in the season. These leaves have been subjected to more sunlight, so the taste is more astringent. They're also ground more quickly than ceremonial matcha leaves, contributing to a slightly coarser powder that's earthy and bitter. This grade is typically combined with other ingredients that help balance and round out its flavor.</p>
